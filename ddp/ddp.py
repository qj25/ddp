            x, u, constrain. This function must be closed-form differentiable
            by sympy. In other words, it must be built with sympy and/or numpy.
            Has to return the next state x' with same dimensions as input state.
        :param inst_cost: instantenious (aka running) cost funciton. Must be a
            callable function with 3 arguments x, u, x_goal. Again, must be
            closed-form differentiatable by sympy.

            callable function with 3 arguments x, u, x_goal. Again, must be
            closed-form differentiatable by sympy.
        :param tolerance: tolerance for convergence. Since DDP does multiple
            runs to optimize a trajectory, we add a tolerance at which optimizing
            further doesn't gain us benfits.

            the hessians of the dynamics. This is the complete form of the original
            algorithm but often the computational cost of computing these hessians
            are not worth convergence rate increase.
        :param constrain: whether to constrain the dynamics
        :param alphas: list of backtracking coefficients. Must be <=0 and in
            decreasing order. The length of the list designates the number
            of backtracking attempts. A common configuration is
            `1.1 ** (-np.arange(10) ** 2)`. Backtracking often helps but
